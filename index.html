<h2 id="portasu">Quick hummus recipe</h2>

<p>
    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that
    I have read over the years.
</p>

<p>
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.

<p>

    <del>Remove the skin from the garlic</del> <u>and chop coarsely </u> <br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely <br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor <br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste. <br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time <br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time <br>
</p>

<p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made
    it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>

<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
